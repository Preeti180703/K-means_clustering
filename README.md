# K-Means Clustering Project
This project demonstrate the implementation of K-means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithem used to group similar data points into clusters .The objective of this project is to analyze patterns in the dataset and segment the data based on feature similarity.
# Algorithm used 
* K-Meaans Clustering(Unsupervised Learning)
# Project Workflow 
1. Data Loading

2. Data Preprocessing & Scaling

3. Fiding optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method

4. Applying K-Means algorithm

5. Visualizing clusters
# Conclusion 
This project help in understanding unsupervised learning, data clustering techniques and real-world data segmentation using machine learning.
